"Discovery" is still a very "sensible" problem for a traveller/tourist, in spit of the advent of "almost real time information, available at finger-tips".

The way to solve this problem is to ask, "What are the kinds of customers, who are still worried/tormented about "discovery" in a new place?"

People who want to do something memorable and authentic and not go by the rut, which is already available on www, on their vacation?

There are only 2 kinds of travellers now-a-days; those who travel for the sake of travel, and those who travel for the sake of IG pics.

If we discount the later, we can arrive at the grand solution.

THE TRUE TRAVELLER IS THE ONE, WHO IS NOT A HOSTAGE OF IG OR FOR THAT MATTER SM.

He is still the guy kind of inspired by ancient long way explorers and misfits like Christopher McCandless and trying to find the same kind of "romance" in today's world.

DISCOVERY REALLY MEANS ONLY TO THOSE, WHO ARE SEEKING IT FOR NOT ANY OTHER ULTERIOR PURPOSE (being famous on SM), OTHER THAN THE DIVINE PLEASURE OF THE DISCOVERY AND SOAKING IN THE MOMENT OF IT.

WE NEED TRAVELLERS AND NOT TOURISTS.

So, who are these kinds of travellers?

These are the ones, who travel to explore, they are not boged down by status-quo of a place (like Twice-In-Nature/La-Vien-Rose) apart from curiosity; but they know, it's not what they are looking for.

Now, the question is, how do we identify and attract, such "travellers"? Fuck tourists?

IDENTIFICATION: Very low budget traveller, interested primarily on a safe+hygienic+comfortable roof over head and a decent breakfast to start the day with; so that she/he can explore the rest of the day, which was the prime objective.

HOOK : Very budgeted stays, Bunk & Breakfast. Meet other like-minded people. Form a local community and see, what you can do explore. How you can make your stay worthwhile?

SELL: Novel Experiences. Earn commission on them. These are the kind of guys who would explore a new music show/ fire show/ theatrics/ jungle safari/ camping / helping locals, for "doing something with community" 

INDUCTION EFFECT : Where the travellers are, tourists would flock. Because tourists travel aiming with the desire to be a traveller, but they are never able to fulfill their desire.Bank on that, un-fulfilled desire. Sell to them, THE ACTION.

IDEA : bnB on Steroids.

GRAND IDEA : Let's make travel great, once again!
